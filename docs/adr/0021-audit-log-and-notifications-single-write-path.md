# ADR-0021: Audit log and notifications — single write path, publisher-over-audit

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-04-19
- **Confidence:** High

## Context

Iteration 8 introduces new mutation surfaces (file uploads, notifications). The Kickoff commits to a configurable notification system ([§Done when](../project/kickoff.md#done-when-final-product)). The current codebase has no unified audit trail — entities carry ad-hoc `createdBy`/`updatedBy` fields and every service method writes its own state change with no append-only record.

Forces:

- **New mutation sites arrive this iteration.** Retrofitting audit later is more expensive than routing new paths through a helper from day one.
- **Notifications need an event source.** Double-writing events at every service-layer site is a drift risk.
- **No regulatory driver.** Value is debugging, dispute resolution, and the "who did what when" view — not compliance.
- **Rebuild-over-forensics posture.** Runtime guards earn their complexity only if catch-rate outweighs the ongoing cost.

## Decision

Route every domain-entity mutation through a single transactional `mutate()` service-layer helper that writes an audit row atomically with the state change. Notifications are a projection over the audit stream via an in-process publisher. Bypass is prevented at PR time by a CI-enforced architecture test. No runtime DB trigger.

Shape:

- **`audit_log` table**, append-only: `id`, `created_at`, `actor_id`, `actor_kind` (`user` | `system`), `actor_reason`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `action`, `payload` (jsonb before/after diff of changed fields), `correlation_id`. Audited entity types: `project`, `customer`, `user`, `project_worker`. Authentication and session events are security events, not domain audit.
- **`mutate()` helper**: opens a transaction, runs the mutation, writes the audit row, commits. The helper returns the committed row so subscribers dispatch after commit (a throwing subscriber cannot roll back domain state). Correlation id is a typed argument through the service chain — services never import Fastify.
- **Self-preference carve-out.** `UserAccount` self-writes of UI preferences (`themePreference`, `pushMuted`) bypass `mutate()` and write directly. Rationale: per-user UI state with no cross-user consequence; routing them through audit dilutes the feed with configuration noise.
- **Architecture test**, CI-enforced: static scan fails on raw `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` or Drizzle `db.insert/update/delete` targeting audited tables outside the helper. Migrations, `ImportService` restore, business seed loaders, and the self-preference carve-out are allowlisted.
- **Notification publisher**: in-process dispatch on commit. Subscribes to `{entity_type, action}` pairs. Non-mutation events (backup status, cron completion) publish to the same bus, bypassing audit.
- **User-facing audit view**: read-only endpoint and UI. RBAC-sliced via the same repository predicates as [ADR-0019](0019-worker-data-scoping-repository-layer-predicate.md).
- **Retention**: aligned with the DB-backup window (90 days per [ADR-0020 Amendment 2026-04-19](0020-layer-2-encrypted-r2-backups-with-operator-loaded-drills.md#amendments)).

## Alternatives Considered

### Runtime DB trigger belt

`BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` rejecting any mutation without a paired audit row in the same transaction. Strongest at-rest guard. Ruled out: ongoing operational cost (migration bypass, fixture-loading complexity, schema-change mental tax) outweighs the catch-rate given a small team, code review, and the static architecture test.

### Two independent systems — audit and notifications each written directly

Ruled out: this is the double-write the helper was introduced to prevent.

### Unified `events` table serving both

Ruled out: shape mismatch (audit wants field-level diffs; notifications want rendered message data) and retention mismatch overload a single schema.

### LISTEN/NOTIFY for cross-process dispatch

Ruled out for now: single-process Fastify makes in-process sufficient. Revisit on multi-worker deployment.

### Full-row audit payloads

Ruled out: storage growth is unbounded; the diff is what both viewers and notification rules actually consume.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single write path — no drift between audit state and entity state.
- Notifications consume a ready-made stream; new rules don't require touching every mutation site.
- User-facing activity view falls out of the same table with RBAC layered at the repository level.
- Architecture test catches bypass at PR time with zero runtime cost.
- Domain-entity scope keeps the activity feed high-signal — login traffic does not drown project transitions.

### Negative

- Architecture test is static — won't catch dynamically constructed SQL. The trigger belt would have; the cost analysis accepts this gap.
- In-process publisher is not durable across restarts. Acceptable at current scale; outbox pattern is the future migration.
- `mutate()` needs the "before" state for update payloads — adds a read on update paths that didn't have one.
- Architecture-test allowlist is a trust surface — each allowlisted path warrants PR-time scrutiny.
- **Security audit required** under [CONTRIBUTING.md §Security audit](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#security-audit) — new persistent log of user actions, new cross-cutting helper.
