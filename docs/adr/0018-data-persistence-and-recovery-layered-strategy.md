# ADR-0018: Data persistence and recovery — layered strategy

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-04-15 (Layer 3 status update 2026-04-29)
- **Confidence:** High

> **2026-04-29 update — Layer 3 is operational.** Binary attachments ship on Backblaze B2 per [ADR-0022](0022-binary-storage-b2-compliance-object-lock.md) (versioning + Compliance Object Lock + capability split). The "aspirational … gated on that work" framing in **Context** and **Consequences §Negative** below is preserved as-of-decision for context but no longer reflects reality. End-to-end encryption of B2 binaries remains open future work — see [DATA.md § Layer 3](../../DATA.md#layer-3--binary-attachments-provider-enforced-durability).

## Context

The kickoff commits to automated database backup (line 72) but declares "a backup concept and system beyond that" out of scope (line 80). Iteration 7 forces the open question: what "backup" actually means here, and how it relates to the test-seeding path that currently bypasses the API.

Three classes of data with different properties:

1. **Business data** — customers, projects, assignments, archive state. Structured, small, strict-schema, portable as text.
2. **Full DB state** — everything SQL persists, including users and sessions. Byte-exact. The DR anchor.
3. **Binary attachments** — photos, Aufmaß, uploads. Large, opaque. Durability is a storage-layer property.

Further constraints:

- **"Data loss is inevitable"** — an unrestored backup is not a backup. Restore must be continuously verified.
- **No backwards-compatibility work** — shims, format migrations, deprecated wrappers are tech debt.
- **VPN-first threat model** (ADR-0008) — accidents and misconfiguration dominate; targeted attack is out of scope.
- **B2 as binary store** ([ADR-0022](0022-binary-storage-b2-compliance-object-lock.md), #45) — not yet integrated; this decision must not assume it.
- **Existing per-entity bulk endpoints** — partial, ad-hoc, overlapping with the goals here.

## Decision

Treat persistence and recovery as **three independent layers**, each with its own scope, tooling, and restore verification:

| Layer                         | Captures                                        | Trigger                                 | Restore                                                          | Verification                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Business data (app-level)** | Customers, projects, assignments, archived rows | Human via UI (`data:export` permission) | Unified import endpoint (`data:restore`), restore-only semantics | CI roundtrip: seed → export → wipe → import → export → byte-compare   |
| **Full DB state**             | Everything in PostgreSQL                        | Scheduled `pg_dump` on the VPS          | `pg_restore`                                                     | Scheduled job restores into ephemeral DB, asserts schema + row counts |
| **Binary attachments**        | Uploaded files                                  | Continuous, storage-provider-owned      | Provider restore mechanics                                       | Provider durability SLA + documented deployment requirements          |

Business-data layer specifics:

- **Single unified endpoint** (`GET /api/export`, `POST /api/import`) — per-entity endpoints removed.
- **Restore-only** import: empty target → proceed; non-empty → refuse unless an explicit override flag is set (dev ergonomics). IDs preserved. All-or-nothing single transaction.
- **Strict schema versioning**: export writes a monotonic `schema_version`; import rejects any mismatch. **No data-format migration code.** Cross-version imports, if ever needed, get a one-off script at that moment.
- **Dry-run mode** on import: full validation and preview, no writes.
- **Users excluded.** Admin bootstrap (ADR-0010) handles user creation on fresh installs. Test seeding uses a direct-DB helper confined to the test layer.
- **Attachments — metadata-only descriptor on the envelope; bytes round-trip via the takeout zip.** The attachments slot on the export envelope carries identity + reachability fields only (`id`, `projectId`, `kind`, `label`, `fileName`, `mimeType`, `sizeBytes`, `createdAt`, `createdBy`); the wrapped-DEK envelopes, the version discriminator, opaque storage keys, and ciphertext sizes do NOT ride the envelope. Plaintext bytes ride alongside as zip entries in the [Vollständiger Export](../spec/ui/daten.md#8113-vollständiger-export) takeout artifact and are restored by the browser orchestrator running the standard `init` (with `restore` block) + presigned PUT + `complete` pipeline against the importing instance — keeping the VPS out of the bulk-plaintext data path per [ADR-0024](0024-binary-attachment-e2e-encryption.md). The text-leg `/api/import` never inserts attachment rows.

The three layers are **complementary, not substitutes.** App-level export is not DR (omits users, sessions, schema state). `pg_dump` is not portability (encodes postgres internals). Binary durability belongs to storage.

## Alternatives Considered

### A single unified backup system

One tool, one artifact, everything. Ruled out: conflates three incompatible data shapes and matches exactly what the kickoff declares out of scope. Also reinvents solutions for problems already handled by existing tools (`pg_dump`, object-storage versioning).

### `pg_dump` as the only strategy

One byte-exact path. Ruled out: no portability between installations, no human-readable test fixtures, leaves the "test data must exercise the API" concern (#90) unaddressed.

### App-level export as the only strategy

Portable and human-readable. Ruled out: cannot capture schema, indices, sequence state, or anything outside domain entities. Portability, not DR.

### Per-entity endpoints kept alongside unified

Keep `/api/export/projects`, `/api/export/customers`, etc. and layer the unified endpoint on top. Ruled out: foreign-system adapters are out of scope, and two shapes (enriched DTO vs. row-fidelity unified) multiply surface area without a concrete beneficiary. Consistent with the no-bw-compat rule.

### App-level data-format migrations

Versioned export with translation code bridging old formats. Ruled out: speculative complexity for a pre-production project with no historical exports that matter. Strict-version rejection preserves the option of a one-off script if production ever demands it.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Each layer uses the right tool for its data shape — no invented machinery.
- Restore is continuously verified at the app level via a CI roundtrip; the test-seed path and the backup path become the same path, exercised every build.
- Strict schema versioning plus no migration code keeps maintenance surface near zero.
- Restore-only semantics make atomicity trivial and eliminate the merge/conflict design space.
- Business-data portability becomes a first-class documented capability (new installations, local dev reset, fixture-driven tests) without claiming to be DR.
- `seed.ts` aligns with the application layer, closing the gap where tests bypassed validation.

### Negative

- Three layers mean three operational stories. A fresh-install operator must learn which layer handles what.
- DB dump kept on the same VPS is a single-site risk — offsite replication is the deployment operator's responsibility.
- Restore-only cannot update a live dataset in place. Partial-data updates remain the CRUD API's job; deliberate.
- Removing per-entity endpoints is a breaking change on paper. No consumers, zero impact, but a large diff.
- Binary-layer durability depends on a storage provider (B2 per [ADR-0022](0022-binary-storage-b2-compliance-object-lock.md), #45) not yet integrated. Binary layer is aspirational until then; the decision stands but implementation is gated on that work.
