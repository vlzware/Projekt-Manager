# ADR-0009: Pin Docker Engine and Compose versions across environments

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-04-07
- **Confidence:** High

## Context

Docker runs in three places: developer workstations, CI (build + Compose validation), and the production VPS. All three install from the official `download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu` apt repo, which always resolves to current stable.

On 2026-04-07 a drift surfaced: the VPS (provisioned 2026-04-06) was on Docker 29.3.1 while a same-day fresh dev install pulled 29.4.0. Both had Compose plugin v5.1.1 by coincidence, not by enforcement. `unattended-upgrades` and `apt upgrade` can silently bump either host; drift compounds over time.

Key forces:

- **Local/prod parity is load-bearing.** ADR-0003 commits us to `docker compose up` producing identical stacks locally and in production. Silent version drift erodes that — a Compose-file or BuildKit syntax that works locally can fail on deploy.
- **VPS runs Docker in production.** Images are built in CI and pulled on the VPS (see [ADR-0011](0011-build-images-in-ci-distribute-via-ghcr.md)), but the VPS Docker version still governs runtime.
- **CI exercises Docker.** `ci.yml` has a `docker` job (Compose validation + image build) and a `build-and-push` job (GHCR publish).
- **Solo operator.** No platform team to absorb surprise breakage. Determinism beats automatic patching at this scale.

## Decision

Pin Docker Engine, CLI, containerd, BuildKit plugin, and Compose plugin to explicit versions on every host; place all five on apt hold. Bumps are deliberate, lockstep across all environments.

**Pinned versions (as of 2026-04-07):**

| Package                 | Version                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `docker-ce`             | `5:29.3.1-1~ubuntu.24.04~noble` |
| `docker-ce-cli`         | `5:29.3.1-1~ubuntu.24.04~noble` |
| `containerd.io`         | `2.2.2-1~ubuntu.24.04~noble`    |
| `docker-buildx-plugin`  | `0.33.0-1~ubuntu.24.04~noble`   |
| `docker-compose-plugin` | `5.1.1-1~ubuntu.24.04~noble`    |

**Source of truth:** the VPS. Local environments match the VPS, not the other way around — so dev reproduces prod rather than leading it.

**Enforcement:** `sudo apt-mark hold` on all five; verify via `apt-mark showhold` on install and on each host audit.

**Upgrade procedure (lockstep):**

1. Review Docker's release notes for the target version.
2. Non-production host first: `apt-mark unhold` → install target → `apt-mark hold` → run the full stack (`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`) + smoke tests.
3. Repeat on remaining hosts, VPS last.
4. Update this ADR with the new pinned versions and date.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Track `latest` (status quo).** `apt-get install docker-ce`, auto-upgrades. Security patches land automatically but breaks local/prod parity silently with no drift monitoring.
- **Snap-based Docker.** `snap install docker`. Not published by Docker Inc., lags upstream, history of cgroup/socket-path quirks breaking Compose v2 healthchecks, opaque update cadence. Trades explicit drift for implicit drift.
- **Ubuntu's `docker.io`.** Distro package, eligible for Ubuntu security updates. Lags upstream on patches; does not include Compose V2 (see `docs/ops/server-setup.md` Phase 4).
- **Pin Engine only, leave plugins floating.** Less maintenance, but Compose-file semantics and BuildKit behaviour live in the plugins — exactly the layer this ADR stabilises.

## Consequences

### Positive

- `docker compose` behaviour is deterministic across local, VPS, and future hosts.
- Silent `apt upgrade` drift is eliminated at the package layer.
- Upgrades are explicit, reviewable changes — easy to correlate with regressions.
- Reproducing production incidents locally is reliable.

### Negative

- Docker security patches require manual operator action; advisories must be tracked.
- Upgrade is a coordinated multi-host procedure; forgetting a host reintroduces drift.
- This ADR's pinned-version table must be kept current.
- Fresh-host setup gains a manual step (install explicit version + hold).

### Mitigations

- Security-advisory tracking mechanism is an open decision; interim backstop is manually checking Docker release notes before any bump.
- `apt-mark showhold` is part of post-install verification (see `docs/ops/server-setup.md` Phase 4).
- Upgrade procedure above is also in `docs/ops/server-setup.md` for operational reference.
