# ADR-0026: Invoices — immutable snapshot, gapless sequence, ZUGFeRD EN 16931

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-12
- **Confidence:** High

## Context

Invoicing is the closing transition of the project workflow ([kickoff.md](../project/kickoff.md): `Rechnung fällig → Abgerechnet`) and the surface the bookkeeper view is built on. Until now the data model has tracked the _state_ of an invoice via the project's `status` column without producing the artifact. This ADR pins the artifact: schema, identifier scheme, e-invoicing format, immutability posture, and the cancellation path.

Forces:

- **Legal anchors are non-negotiable.** German statute pins the shape directly:
  - **§14 UStG** mandates issuer block, recipient block, sequential invoice number, issue date, performance date, line items, tax breakdown.
  - **§14a UStG** mandates B2B e-invoicing capability: receive EN 16931 from 2025-01-01; send from 2027-01-01 (with phase-in for low-turnover issuers through 2028).
  - **§147 AO** requires invoices and supporting records be retained 10 years.
  - **§19 UStG** Kleinunternehmer issuers must omit VAT and carry the mandatory boilerplate.
  - **§13b UStG** reverse-charge inverts VAT liability — for Handwerker, Abs. 2 Nr. 4 covers Bauleistungen.
  - **GoBD** requires immutability, traceability, and retention — enforced at the storage layer, not by application convention.
- **Snapshot or drift.** Customer addresses, USt-IdNr., line wording, tax rates, and the issuer's own company profile evolve over years. An issued invoice must render identically forever; lookup-by-FK against live rows is incompatible with that requirement.
- **Gapless sequences are an audit-trail expectation.** German tax auditors flag gaps in invoice numbering as an open question by default. Postgres `SERIAL`/`IDENTITY` advance on rollback and silently leak gaps — incompatible with the requirement.
- **No backwards compatibility burden.** No issued invoices exist; the schema can be shaped for the right model directly (project convention).
- **Project primitives already exist.** Audit log + single-write path ([ADR-0021](0021-audit-log-and-notifications-single-write-path.md)), B2 binary descriptor flow with Compliance Object Lock ([ADR-0022](0022-binary-storage-b2-compliance-object-lock.md)), e2e encryption of binaries ([ADR-0024](0024-binary-attachment-e2e-encryption.md)), SSE invalidation ([ADR-0025](0025-realtime-ui-invalidation-via-sse.md)), repository-predicate worker scoping ([ADR-0019](0019-worker-data-scoping-repository-layer-predicate.md)) — the invoice domain composes on these rather than introducing parallel infrastructure.

## Decision

We will model invoices as **immutable issued snapshots with a gapless year-scoped sequence, rendered as ZUGFeRD EN 16931 (Comfort) PDF/A-3**, anchored in the existing audit, storage, and notification primitives. The closest production analogue is the **Stripe Invoices** model (issued invoices are content-frozen; corrections are sibling credit notes rather than edits) combined with the **DATEV** convention for German numbering (year-scoped `RE-YYYY-NNNN`, distinct prefix for Stornorechnung).

### Data model

- **New `invoices` table — snapshot at issuance.** Issuer block (company name, address, tax id, USt-IdNr., IBAN, footer text), recipient block (customer name + address), line items as a JSONB array, tax aggregation, totals, dates (issue, performance/Leistungsdatum), identifiers (number, status), `taxMode` (snapshotted), `profile` (ZUGFeRD profile snapshotted), binary descriptor reference to the rendered PDF/A-3, `cancellationOf` (nullable self-FK to the original invoice for Stornorechnung rows). Issued rows are write-once after the issuance transaction commits.
- **New `invoice_sequence` table — gapless allocation.** One row per `(year, kind)` where `kind ∈ {'invoice', 'storno'}` with `nextValue bigint NOT NULL`. Allocation is `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the matching row inside the same transaction that inserts the invoice; the lock is held until commit, so a rollback returns the value to the sequence. This is the canonical Postgres pattern for gapless counters and is incompatible with `SERIAL`/`IDENTITY`, which advance on rollback by design.
- **New `company_profile` table — single row.** Columns: company name, address, tax id, USt-IdNr., logo (binary descriptor reference), IBAN, accent color, footer text, `defaultTaxMode`. Singleton enforced by a CHECK on a constant primary key (same shape as `meta_backup_status.singleton`). Owner-only CRUD; the row is pre-seeded by the baseline migration so write paths upsert rather than first-write.
- **New `AuditEntityType: 'invoice'`.** Added to the `AUDIT_ENTITY_TYPES` array and `AUDIT_ENTITY_TO_TABLE` map in `schema.ts`; the architecture check ([scripts/check-audit-mutations.sh](../../scripts/check-audit-mutations.sh)) derives the audited-tables list from this constant. The `audit_log_entity_type_valid` and `audit_log_ancestor_type_valid` CHECKs are extended in lock-step.

### State machine

- **`draft`** — fully editable, no number assigned, deletable. Lines, recipient, tax mode all mutable.
- **`issued`** — at the issuance transaction: number allocated from `invoice_sequence.FOR UPDATE`, content frozen (no UPDATE path on issued rows beyond the cancellation flag), PDF/A-3 + ZUGFeRD XML rendered, blob written through the [ADR-0022](0022-binary-storage-b2-compliance-object-lock.md)/[ADR-0024](0024-binary-attachment-e2e-encryption.md) pipeline, project status transitioned to `abgerechnet`, audit row written, SSE `invoice_changed` event emitted post-commit. All one transaction.
- **`cancelled`** — a flag on the original issued row. Cancellation does not edit the original; it **inserts a sibling Stornorechnung row** with its own `ST-YYYY-NNNN` number from the `storno` sub-sequence, line amounts negated, mandatory `cancellationOf` pointing at the original. Both rows persist forever. A _corrected_ invoice is a fresh `draft → issued` cycle, not a Storno variant. Project status is **not** auto-reverted on cancellation — surfaced as a UI banner so the operator decides what to do with the project state.

### Numbering

- **Invoice:** `RE-YYYY-NNNN` (e.g. `RE-2026-0001`). Year-scoped, gapless within `(year, 'invoice')`.
- **Storno:** `ST-YYYY-NNNN`. Separate sub-sequence within `(year, 'storno')`. The distinct prefix discriminates at a glance and matches the German DATEV convention (RE = Rechnung, ST = Storno).
- **Format pinned at the DB.** A CHECK constraint on `invoices.number` enforces the regex `^(RE|ST)-\d{4}-\d{4,}$` so a misshapen number cannot land even via raw SQL. The four-digit-minimum suffix allows growth past 9999 without a schema migration; the regex anchors the prefix and the year width.

### E-invoice format

- **ZUGFeRD profile EN 16931 (Comfort), PDF/A-3 wrapper with embedded `factur-x.xml`.** Both human-readable (PDF) and machine-readable (XML) in one file; the industry default for B2B DE under §14a. The Comfort profile is the EN 16931-conformant tier — sufficient for the §14a mandate and what most ERP receivers expect.
- **XRECHNUNG is a future-work seam, not v1 scope.** Required only for public-sector clients; the schema accommodates it via the snapshotted `profile` column on the invoice row (current values: `'zugferd-en16931'`; future: `'xrechnung'`, `'zugferd-xrechnung'`). The renderer is selected by `profile` at issuance; pure-XML XRECHNUNG produces an XML file rather than PDF/A-3 — the storage shape and audit shape are unchanged.
- **Per-customer toggle is a future-work seam.** v1 issues with the company-default profile; a `customers.defaultInvoiceProfile` column is a non-breaking later addition.

### Storage and retention

- PDF/A-3 (ZUGFeRD-wrapped) stored via the existing binary descriptor flow — same init/complete pipeline as attachments, same E2E envelope ([ADR-0024](0024-binary-attachment-e2e-encryption.md)) so B2 sees only ciphertext.
- **Object Lock retention is env-driven.** `INVOICE_OBJECT_LOCK_DAYS` defaults to `3650` (10 years, §147 AO); `.env.example` ships `0` to disable retention in dev so binaries can be cleaned up freely. The boot-time bucket configuration assertion ([ADR-0022](0022-binary-storage-b2-compliance-object-lock.md) `assertStorageBucketSafe()`) is extended to verify the invoice retention envelope against the env value — misconfiguration refuses to start (project principle: refuse to serve when an integrity criterion cannot be met).
- Lifecycle and capability split from ADR-0022 are reused unchanged — the bucket primitives operate on opaque bytes, so the Object Lock window defends ciphertext exactly as it defends attachment ciphertext.

### Tax modes

Three modes in v1, each rendered with the correct legal boilerplate:

- **`standard`** — per-line VAT (19% / 7%), full tax breakdown in the totals block.
- **`kleinunternehmer`** — §19 UStG: no VAT columns, mandatory boilerplate ("Gemäß § 19 UStG wird keine Umsatzsteuer berechnet").
- **`reverse_charge`** — §13b UStG: no VAT on lines, mandatory recipient-pays note ("Steuerschuldnerschaft des Leistungsempfängers gemäß § 13b UStG"). For Handwerker Bauleistungen this is §13b Abs. 2 Nr. 4.

`company_profile.defaultTaxMode` pre-fills new drafts. The draft's `taxMode` is editable until issuance. **At issuance the value is snapshotted onto the invoice row and frozen** — the issued row carries its own copy and is not re-derived from `company_profile` on render.

### Permissions

- **`invoice:write`** — owner, office.
- **`invoice:read`** — owner, office, bookkeeper.
- **Worker:** no access. The repository-predicate scope ([ADR-0019](0019-worker-data-scoping-repository-layer-predicate.md)) already gates worker visibility through project-assignment; invoices have no `project_worker` scope path, so the predicate returns the empty set for the worker role — no special case needed at the route layer.

### Audit and realtime

- Draft mutations, issuance, and cancellation all flow through the single-write `mutate()` path ([ADR-0021](0021-audit-log-and-notifications-single-write-path.md)). Audit entity type `'invoice'`; ancestor denormalization sets `(ancestor_entity_type='project', ancestor_entity_id=projectId)` so the project-detail activity feed surfaces invoice events on the same indexed predicate as attachments.
- SSE event name `invoice_changed`, emitted post-commit from the mutation call sites per [ADR-0025](0025-realtime-ui-invalidation-via-sse.md). Payload is the standard invalidation ping; the client refetches via the gated read endpoints.

### Future-work seams (recorded, not implemented)

- **XRECHNUNG profile** — schema field `profile` already discriminates; the renderer dispatch and the public-sector receiver surface land when the first such customer appears.
- **Per-customer template variants** — non-breaking `customers.defaultInvoiceProfile` (and, if needed, accent/footer overrides) when a customer population needs differentiation.
- **Line-item import** — out of scope v1; manual line entry is the only path. The JSONB shape accommodates an import without migration.

## Alternatives Considered

### PDF-only output, defer ZUGFeRD/EN 16931 until forced

Ship a plain PDF in v1 and add EN 16931 when the 2027-01-01 send mandate hits. Ruled out: the mandate date is published and external, "defer" against a known regulatory deadline is the canonical shape of avoidable debt, and the EN 16931 schema is the part that must be right from day 1 — line shapes, party identifiers, tax codes need to round-trip through the official validators. Catching them at scale-out is materially worse than catching them on the first issuance.

### XRECHNUNG pure XML, no PDF

Spec-conformant for public-sector. Ruled out: customers in the Handwerker B2B scope expect a readable artifact; pure XML inverts that expectation. ZUGFeRD ships both in one file and covers the same EN 16931 semantic — superset for the actual customer mix. XRECHNUNG remains the future-work seam for public-sector clients.

### Normalized `invoice_lines` table (FK from line rows to the invoice header)

Standard third-normal-form modeling: query-able historical line items, FK integrity. Ruled out: lines are part of the immutable snapshot — the row freezes at issuance and is never queried for analytic aggregations across lines. The relational shape adds FK graph weight (cascade rules, ordering column, per-line audit smear) for a query workload that does not exist. JSONB on the header is the right shape when the contained data is immutable and read as a unit; it matches the issuance/render lifecycle exactly.

### Postgres `SERIAL` / `IDENTITY` for the invoice number

Trivially gapless-looking, well-supported. Ruled out: both leak gaps on rollback — the sequence advances even when the inserting transaction aborts, and the gap is permanent. Gapless numbering is anchored in §14 UStG audit practice (the auditor's default question is "why is RE-2026-0014 missing"), so a sequence model that produces gaps is a category error here. The `FOR UPDATE` row lock on `invoice_sequence` is the canonical Postgres pattern when gaplessness is required and writes are low-rate.

### Soft-delete instead of immutability + Stornorechnung

A `deleted` flag on `invoices` analogous to `projects.deleted`. Ruled out: GoBD forbids destruction of issued business records; the application layer cannot grant itself permission to hide them. Stornorechnung is the legally-conforming corrective primitive — a fresh sibling document, not a flip on the original.

### Per-customer or per-project template variants in v1

Per-customer branding/footer/accent overrides. Out of scope: one code template + one `company_profile` row is sufficient under [ADR-0001](0001-generalized-system-with-configurable-customer-specifics.md)'s single-tenant deployment, and the per-customer seam is non-breaking when it lands. Building it now spends design surface on a need that has not surfaced.

### Default-mode on profile + per-invoice override boolean for tax

Keep `company_profile.defaultTaxMode` plus a `taxModeOverride boolean` on the invoice row. Ruled out: the snapshot pattern already requires the invoice row to carry its own frozen `taxMode` (issuance freezes it regardless of override). An additional boolean is dead modeling — the resolved value already lives where it needs to.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Legal compliance from day 1.** §14, §14a, §147, §19, §13b, GoBD all anchored — receive-EN-16931 capability is met for 2025-01-01 and send-EN-16931 capability is met for 2027-01-01 without a follow-up program.
- **Historical readability is structural.** Issued invoices render identically forever because the snapshot is on the row, not chased through joins against mutable parents.
- **Gapless numbering survives rollback** by construction (`FOR UPDATE` on `invoice_sequence` inside the issuing transaction). No reconciliation pass, no "missing number" auditor question.
- **Immutability is storage-enforced**, not policy-enforced. Compliance Object Lock on the rendered PDF/A-3 means even a compromised app credential cannot destroy issued artifacts within the retention window.
- **No new infrastructure.** Reuses audit, storage, encryption, SSE, and the scope predicate. The invoice domain is a fifth audited entity type, not a parallel stack.
- **Stornorechnung is a regular row.** The cancellation primitive does not need special-casing in audit, storage, listing, or permissions — it is an invoice with `cancellationOf` set and a Storno prefix.

### Negative

- **Manual line-item entry only in v1.** No import path; bookkeeper-facing pain on long line lists. The JSONB shape accommodates an importer without migration when the need is concrete.
- **Single `company_profile` row constrains multi-entity tenants.** Acceptable under [ADR-0001](0001-generalized-system-with-configurable-customer-specifics.md); if a customer ever operates two issuing entities under one deployment, the singleton lifts to a row-per-entity with a `companyProfileId` FK on `invoices`.
- **ZUGFeRD adds a toolchain surface.** PDF/A-3 generation, the `factur-x.xml` builder against the EN 16931 schema, and validation against the official validator (`Mustangproject` / KoSIT validator). The render path is a new failure mode — a malformed XML payload fails at the toolchain layer rather than at issuance.
- **Stornorechnung surfaces as a distinct row in invoice lists.** UI must group it visually under the original; bookkeeper exports include both. Acceptable — it is the artifact a tax auditor expects to see.
- **Object Lock + Compliance retention is unforgiving.** A Storno-then-correct cycle is the only correction path; there is no "fix a typo on the issued invoice" door, by design.

### Operational

- Schema delta lands as edits to `src/server/db/schema.ts` + a regenerated baseline migration (project convention: no incremental Drizzle migration files, no production data to preserve). The new `invoices`, `invoice_sequence`, and `company_profile` tables, the `AUDIT_ENTITY_TYPES` extension, the `AUDIT_ENTITY_TO_TABLE` map entry, and the two `audit_log_*_type_valid` CHECK updates land in the same edit.
- New env var `INVOICE_OBJECT_LOCK_DAYS` and corresponding entries in `.env.production.example` + the env-drift gate (`scripts/check-env-drift.sh`). Dev `.env.example` ships `0`.
- The boot-time `assertStorageBucketSafe()` is extended to verify the invoice retention envelope; misconfiguration refuses to start the `app` service.
- New SSE event name `invoice_changed` registered with the event-name registry — no `/api/events` route change.
- New permission keys `invoice:read` and `invoice:write` added to the permission registry; the bookkeeper role (currently a stub) gains `invoice:read`.
- ZUGFeRD generation is a new server-side dependency (`Mustangproject` or equivalent — exact package picked in spec). Build-image surface grows by the JVM / native dep that ships with the chosen library.
- **Security audit not required.** Trigger evaluation against [CONTRIBUTING.md §Security audit](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#security-audit): authentication unchanged (existing session cookies), authorization is two new permission keys consumed by the existing predicate-and-permission registry, storage reuses the ADR-0022/ADR-0024 binary pipeline with no new key material or transport, external communication is unchanged (no new outbound surface — invoices are stored, not transmitted), network exposure adds no new endpoints beyond gated read/write routes that are structurally identical to existing entity routes. No trust boundary moves. User confirmation requested as a backstop per CONTRIBUTING §7–8.
