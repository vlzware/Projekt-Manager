# Binary Attachment Key — Overview

Operator navigation page for the binary-attachment end-to-end-encryption identity ([ADR-0024](../../adr/0024-binary-attachment-e2e-encryption.md)). Design rationale and alternatives live in the ADR; this runbook is procedures only. The big-picture map across all three data layers lives in the root [DATA.md](../../../DATA.md).

## What the binary identity is

A long-lived `age` X25519 key pair whose public recipient (`BINARY_AGE_RECIPIENT`) is embedded in the `app` container env, and whose private identity lives only on the operator workstation. Every binary uploaded through the app is encrypted in the browser with a fresh per-blob AES-256-GCM data-encryption key (DEK); the server wraps that DEK with the public recipient and stores the wrapped envelope (`wrappedDek`) on the `attachment` row. B2 sees only ciphertext — the bytes plus a per-blob nonce, opaque to the provider.

```

The Service Worker decrypt path (synthetic origin `/encrypted-storage/<projectId>/<attachmentId>.<variant>`) fetches DEK material from the app, decrypts ciphertext from B2, and serves plaintext bytes to `<img>`, `<iframe>` PDF preview, and `<a href download>` consumers. Bulk download uses per-file `bulk-fetch` + browser-side streaming-zip — no server-side zip artifact.

## What it protects

B2 ciphertext. Provider operations, support staff with bucket access, leaked data-plane S3 tokens, and subpoenas served to Backblaze all see only opaque bytes ([ADR-0024 §Threat model](../../adr/0024-binary-attachment-e2e-encryption.md#decision)). A live VPS with the identity loaded is **out of scope** — code execution on the running app reads DEKs as the app does. Lost VPS disk is fine — the identity is tmpfs-only.

## Relation to the backup drill key

The binary identity and the backup drill identity are **independent keypairs** (separate env vars `BINARY_AGE_RECIPIENT` / `AGE_RECIPIENT`, separate tmpfs files, independent rotation cadence, independent blast radius). After every VPS reboot, the operator pastes **both** identities — order does not matter, but the failure modes diverge:

- Missed binary paste = **app refuses to start** ([ADR-0024 §Decision "Boot probe"](../../adr/0024-binary-attachment-e2e-encryption.md#decision)). Hard down. Operator notices because the app is unreachable.
- Missed backup paste = Tier 2 drills stale, freshness badge amber ([ADR-0020](../../adr/0020-layer-2-encrypted-r2-backups-with-operator-loaded-drills.md)). App keeps serving.

Two pastes after every reboot is the canonical post-restart workflow. See [load.md § Two-paste workflow](load.md#two-paste-workflow).
