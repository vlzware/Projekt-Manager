# Layer 2 Backup — Troubleshooting and Escalation

When `meta_backup_status.lastBackupOk` stays `false`, the service crash-loops, or manifests don't match.

Concept map: [overview.md](overview.md). Setup / rotation: [setup.md](setup.md). DR: [recovery.md](recovery.md).

## First-deploy failure modes

Symptoms that appear during or right after [setup.md §4](setup.md#4-first-deploy):

## First-line diagnostics (5 minutes)

SSH to the VPS as the admin user, then run these via `sudo -u deploy`. Use `docker` directly, not `docker compose`. `docker compose <cmd>` re-parses `docker-compose.yml` on every invocation, which requires every interpolation var (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `STORAGE_SECRET_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, …) in shell env; the admin's sudo shell doesn't have `secrets.env.age` sourced, so parse aborts with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN must be declared`. `docker ps` / `docker exec` / `docker logs` don't touch compose, so they work directly. Same class of problem fixed in `server-setup.md` Phase 8.1 (commit 5484903).

```bash
sudo -u deploy docker ps -a --filter name=projekt-manager-backup
sudo -u deploy docker logs projekt-manager-backup-1 --tail=200
sudo -u deploy docker exec projekt-manager-db-1 psql -U pm -d projekt_manager -c 'SELECT * FROM meta_backup_status;'
```

`lastError` is a short machine cue from the backup script — the log tail carries the detail.

## Second-line (manual one-shot, deep-dive)

Trigger a backup manually and read the full output. This `docker exec`s into the running backup container; the in-process croner schedule keeps running in PID 1. Note: manual one-shot runs are NOT serialised against scheduled ticks (croner's `protect: true` only covers intra-process overlap). In practice each run picks a fresh ISO-timestamped artifact key, so an accidental overlap is at most a duplicate log line — not data corruption.

```bash
sudo -u deploy docker exec projekt-manager-backup-1 node /app/dist/server/backup-runner.js run
```

If the container isn't running (e.g. crash-looping on env validation or the startup R2 HeadBucket probe), `docker logs` from First-line diagnostics is the starting point, not this — `docker exec` needs a live PID 1.

Common buckets:

- R2 credential drift — re-run [setup.md §3](setup.md#3-push-r2-credentials--recipient-to-the-vps).
- Age recipient mismatch — re-run [setup.md §3](setup.md#3-push-r2-credentials--recipient-to-the-vps) with `age-keygen -y`.
- PostgreSQL connectivity — check `db` container health.
- Manifest algorithm drift — check [AC-174](../../spec/verification.md#1522-backup-and-recovery) determinism; run the checksum query twice on the same snapshot and compare.

## Escalation threshold

If you cannot restore the most recent green-labelled backup to a scratch DB per [recovery.md steps 1–5](recovery.md), the backup is not a backup. Do not accept the system as healthy.

Next steps:

1. Step back one day and retry.
2. If every available dump fails, prepare for full reconstruction from Layer 1 business-data export ([api.md §14.2.4](../../spec/api.md#1424-unified-data-exchange)) plus a fresh admin bootstrap (see the "First-login ritual" phase in [server-setup.md](../server-setup.md)).

This reconstruction loses users, sessions, and audit FKs — it is worst-case recovery, not a replacement for Layer 2.

## Owner / escalation contact

The project is currently single-operator. The owner (Vladimir) is the escalation contact for every failure class above. If the owner is unavailable and the outage blocks business operations, the fallback plan is the Layer 1 business-data export ([ADR-0018](../../adr/0018-data-persistence-and-recovery-layered-strategy.md)) restored onto a fresh bootstrap — partial recovery, no users/sessions/audit, but projects and customers survive.
