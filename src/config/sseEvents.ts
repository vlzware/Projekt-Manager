/**
 * Catalog of realtime invalidation event names — the wire vocabulary
 * shared between the server bus (`src/server/sse/`) and the browser
 * subscriber (`src/sse/`). Each constant is the literal string that
 * lands on the SSE `event:` line; tests pin the wire format against
 * the same constants so a typo at any emit or subscribe site fails
 * compilation rather than silently dropping invalidation.
