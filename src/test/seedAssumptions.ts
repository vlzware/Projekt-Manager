/**
 * Seed and deployment-configuration assumptions — single source of truth
 * for values tests expect the running system to be configured with.
 *
 * This file is an "assumption contract": seed-produced values (usernames,
 * default password) and deployment-level configuration values (e.g. the
 * destructive-restore confirmation phrase) the test layer pins against.
 * Every assertion that depends on such a value should reference one of
 * these constants rather than hardcoding the literal. A change to the
 * producing source (`seed.ts`, config module, ...) then produces a typed
 * compiler error here — and through here in every consuming test —
 * instead of silently breaking runtime assertions across many files.
 *
 * When the producing source changes:
 *   1. Update this file to match.
 *   2. Run the full test suite.
 *   3. Fix any test that legitimately depended on the old value.
 *
 * Do NOT loosen an assertion to avoid updating a constant. The constant is
 * a typed reference to the same value the producing source uses —
 * loosening hides the coupling instead of surfacing it.

 * username so a test reads as "log in as the owner" rather than "log in
 * as 'inhaber'" — the username becomes an implementation detail.
