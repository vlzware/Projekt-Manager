/**
 * Backup-freshness badge derivation — pure function layer.
 *
 * Given a `BackupStatus` (or `undefined` for "unreachable") and a set
 * of freshness thresholds, derives the badge state rendered on the
 * owner's authenticated landing view.
 *
 * Mapping rules (verification.md §15.22, AC-170 / AC-171):
 *   - `status === undefined`         → { kind: 'unknown' }
 *                                       (DB down AND mirror unavailable)
 *   - `lastBackupOk === false`
 *     AND `lastBackupAt === undefined`
 *                                     → { kind: 'red', reason: 'backup-never-run' }
 *                                       (pre-seed row — no run has ever happened)
 *   - `lastBackupOk === false`       → { kind: 'red', reason: 'last-run-failed' }
 *                                       (a real run failed — `lastBackupAt` is set)
 *   - `lastDrillOk === null`         → { kind: 'red', reason: 'drill-never-run' }
 *                                       (no Tier 2 drill has ever succeeded or failed —
 *                                        data-model.md §5.9 authoritative null signal)
 *   - backup age > backupRedDays     → { kind: 'red', reason: 'backup-stale' }
 *   - drill age > drillRedDays       → { kind: 'red', reason: 'backup-stale' }
 *                                       (drill staleness is a red signal at the red
 *                                        threshold — AC-171 treats an unverified
 *                                        backup cycle as worse than a stale one)
 *   - drill age > drillAmberDays     → { kind: 'amber', reason: 'drill-stale' }
 *   - otherwise                      → { kind: 'green' }
 *
 * The label on the 'unknown' branch is a German UI string per AC-171 —
 * "Status unbekannt". Rendering code may sentence-case it; tests match
 * case-insensitively so the component is free to choose.
 *
 * Pure function: no I/O, no React, no DB. Safe to import from both
 * server (for the authenticated endpoint response) and client (for
 * rendering) per the shared-domain layering rule in architecture.md §11.2.
