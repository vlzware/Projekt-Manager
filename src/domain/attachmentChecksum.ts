/**
 * Browser-side MD5-of-ciphertext helper for attachment uploads.
 *
 * Extracted from `state/attachmentStore.ts` so the import-orchestrator
 * (`ui/management/useImportAllRunner.ts`) and the standard upload path
 * share one implementation. Both routes need RFC 1864 base64 of the
 * 16-byte digest — that is what the server signs into the presigned
 * PUT's `Content-MD5` header (ADR-0024 / api.md §14.2.11), and what
 * the storage provider verifies the body against.
 *
 * MD5 is required by the S3 wire protocol (`Content-MD5`); imported
 * from `@noble/hashes/legacy` because Paul Miller's noble suite
 * deliberately walls MD5 / SHA-1 off into `/legacy` to signal that
 * they should never be used for new crypto — we are only here because
 * the storage provider's API contract forces it.
 *
 * Streams the digest in 2 MiB chunks so the full bytes never
 * materialize twice in memory; cheap on phones, fast enough that no
 * Web Worker is warranted at the per-file cap.
