/**
 * Seed loader for v1 notification rules — ADR-0023 §Decision (initial
 * event set). Populated once during seed hydration; production deployments
 * run the same seed on first boot (SEED=true) and the admin adjusts rules
 * after the first login.
 *
 * Rule choices (recorded here as canonical starting state; revisit in
 * the admin UI as usage emerges):
 *   - project.transition_forward  → assigned workers
 *   - project.transition_backward → assigned workers
 *   - project.archived            → owner
 *   - project.assignment_changed  → assigned workers
 *   - backup.failed               → owner
 *   - disk.threshold_reached      → owner
 *
 * Rationale: the per-project events target the people actually doing the
 * work (assigned workers). Owner stays out of these defaults because the
 * activity feed already surfaces every mutation to them — there is no
 * signal loss. Archive is an owner-only event (destructive), matching
 * the matrix where `project:purge` and archive visibility are owner
 * territory. Backup / disk events are infrastructure concerns the owner
 * operates, so the default recipient is owner only.
 *
 * This is a direct-DB INSERT path — the seed hydrates administrative
 * config, not a normal rule edit, so the `audit_log` row would be noise
 * and ADR-0021 §Decision explicitly allowlists seed writes.
