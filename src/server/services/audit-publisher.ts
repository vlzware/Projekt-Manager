/**
 * Post-commit audit publisher — api.md §14.2.8.
 *
 * ADR-0021 splits the audit-write path from subscriber dispatch: the
 * `mutate()` helper writes the domain mutation and the `audit_log` row
 * in one transaction, and only after that transaction commits does the
 * helper invoke `dispatch()` here. A throwing subscriber therefore cannot
 * roll back the originating mutation — AC-183.
 *
 * Surface (pinned by api.md §14.2.8 "Post-commit publisher contract"):
 *
 *   onAuditCommitted(handler) → unsubscribe
 *     Handlers are invoked once per commit, in registration order
 *     (Set iteration order = insertion order in modern JS runtimes).
 *
 *   setOperationalLogger(logger)
 *     Wires the structured operational logger used to surface handler
 *     failures. Without this wiring, a subscriber failure is silently
 *     swallowed — the failure-surface contract (AC-183) mandates a
 *     structured log line, so production code must call this once at
 *     startup.
 *
 *   dispatch(row)
 *     Internal — called by `mutate()` after commit. Exported so tests
 *     can drive the publisher directly if needed.
