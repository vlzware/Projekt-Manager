/**
 * Audit-log retention cleanup — data-model.md §6.10, AC-184.
 *
 * Removes `audit_log` rows older than the configured rolling window
 * (90 days [C] by default). This is the *only* path that deletes from
 * `audit_log`: every other application path is append-only and the
 * single-write helper `mutate()` never deletes. The architecture check
 * in `scripts/check-audit-mutations.sh` allowlists this file for that
 * reason.
 *
 * Contract with operators (AC-184):
 *   - Emits exactly one structured operational log line per run, at
 *     `info` level, with fields `event`, `window_days`, `removed_count`
 *     (non-negative integer; 0 on a no-op), and `ran_at` (ISO 8601).
 *   - Does NOT itself produce an `audit_log` row — scope is domain
 *     entities only (data-model.md §5.10).
 *
 * Concurrency: a single `DELETE WHERE created_at < :cutoff` runs under
 * Postgres default isolation (READ COMMITTED). Rows inserted after the
 * cutoff is computed are not eligible for this run; they roll into the
 * next run. No explicit transaction is opened — the DELETE is
 * self-contained and idempotent.
 *
 * Dependency-injected logger: the service accepts the logger at call
 * time rather than reading from module state so
 *   (a) tests can assert exactly one call against a spy, and
 *   (b) the scheduler wires in the same `ServiceLogger` surface other
 *       services already accept (see `src/server/services/Logger.ts`).
