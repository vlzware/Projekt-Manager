/**
 * API integration test — `createDraft` TOCTOU on the archived-project
 * check (security-audit finding M2 / AC-285).
 *
 * Current `InvoiceService.createDraft` reads the project row from
 * `this.db` BEFORE `mutate()` opens the audit transaction:
 *
 *   1. profileService.get()              — `this.db.select(...).from(companyProfile)`
 *   2. db.select(projects).where(id=…)   — TOCTOU read
 *   3. db.select(customers).where(...)
 *   4. mutate(this.db, …, run: tx => insertInvoiceDraft(tx, …))
 *
 * Between (2) and (4) the project state is observed without a row lock
 * and without the audit transaction's snapshot. A concurrent commit
 * that flips `projects.deleted = true` after (2) but before (4) slips
 * a draft onto an archived project — AC-285 promises 404 NOT_FOUND
 * for that case (mirrors AC-95 for draft writes).
 *
 * After Wave 3 the project lookup moves inside `mutate()`'s `run(tx)`
 * callback, sharing the audit transaction's READ COMMITTED snapshot
 * with the INSERT. Any archive committed before the tx starts is then
 * visible to the lookup and the insert is rejected.
 *
 * Test strategy — deterministic interleaving via a one-shot spy on
 * `db.transaction`:
 *   - Build the service against pool A.
 *   - Spy on `connA.db.transaction` to, on its FIRST call, archive
 *     the project via pool B (committing before the spy returns
 *     control to the real `transaction()`).
 *   - Call `service.createDraft(...)` directly.
 *
 * The spy fires AFTER the pre-transaction project read at (2) — by
 * construction `createDraft` reaches the `mutate()` call only after
 * reading the project. The archive thus lands in the window the AC
 * forbids.
 *
 * Pre-fix expectation: the insert succeeds, the test fails at the
 * `expect.toThrow(...)` / no-row assertion.
 * Post-fix expectation: the lookup runs inside the tx, sees
 * `deleted=true`, and throws `NOT_FOUND` — the test passes.
 *
 * Why direct service call instead of HTTP: the route's surface is
 * already covered by `invoices-routes.test.ts` (AC-285 happy + archived
 * cases). The race condition is a service-layer invariant; calling the
 * service directly with our own `db` handle gives us the connection-
 * level seam without dragging Fastify middleware into the test.
