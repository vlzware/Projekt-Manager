/**
 * Boot-time bucket-safety probe. ADR-0022 / docs/ops/object-storage-provisioning.md
 * pin a precise bucket shape — Compliance Object Lock, Versioning, and a
 * single canonical lifecycle rule — AND a credential capability split
 * (the app key cannot destroy versions). This module verifies both and
 * refuses to start on data-corruption-class drift in either.
 *
 * Shape (validator):
 *   - Versioning: Enabled
 *   - Object Lock: Enabled, default retention COMPLIANCE for R days
 *   - Lifecycle: exactly one Enabled rule, no prefix/tag filter,
 *     NoncurrentVersionExpiration.NoncurrentDays = L,
 *     no other actions (no Expiration.Days — would auto-hide live data;
 *     no Transitions — wrong storage class semantic).
 *
 * `Expiration.ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker = true` is intentionally NOT
 * required — it is a MinIO / AWS S3 idiom, not a data-integrity invariant.
 * On Backblaze B2 (the prod target, ADR-0022), the native lifecycle action
 * `daysFromHidingToDeleting` reaps the hidden version AND its delete
 * marker together; the S3-compat surface does not surface
 * `ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker=true` for that case. Requiring the field
 * would refuse to start against a correctly-configured B2 bucket. MinIO's
 * `docker/init-storage.sh` still sets `--expire-delete-marker`
 * unconditionally so dev rules carry the field; that is parity at the
 * provisioning layer, not a probe-time check.
 *
 * Capability self-test:
 *   The shape check above does not verify the *primary* defense — that
 *   the running credential lacks `deleteFiles` (B2) /
 *   `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` (MinIO/AWS). If someone re-issues the app
 *   key with destroy capability by mistake, every shape probe still
 *   passes and the credential can destroy any version older than the
 *   retention window. The self-test issues a `DeleteObjectCommand` with
 *   a format-valid-but-nonexistent `VersionId` against a sentinel key
 *   (`__probe/safety`) and asserts `AccessDenied` is the response —
 *   meaning the capability layer refused before the existence check
 *   ran.
 *
 *   Why a bogus VersionId, not a sentinel write:
 *     - On B2 with a `writeFiles, readFiles, listFiles` key, the
 *       `b2_delete_file_version` capability check fires before the
 *       version-existence check, so the bogus VersionId never matters.
 *       Verified end-to-end against B2 in 2026-04 (see
 *       docs/wip/verify-hide-capability-split.sh).
 *     - On MinIO with a restricted user (no `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`),
 *       the IAM policy denies the action before resolution. Same shape.
 *     - A sentinel write would auto-apply Compliance retention
 *       (`R` days) and never be deletable by design — heavier fixture
 *       with the same outcome. The bogus-version path keeps the probe
 *       side-effect-free and identical across providers.
 *
 *   Failure semantics — fail-closed for any non-AccessDenied outcome:
 *     - 204 success → credential CAN destroy (catastrophic dev/prod drift)
 *     - NoSuchVersion / NoSuchKey → provider checked existence first;
 *       the response leaks no perms info, so we cannot trust the
 *       capability split is actually in place
 *     - InvalidArgument (malformed VersionId) → provider validated the
 *       format before perms; same ambiguity
 *     - Network / timeout → ambiguous; refuse to serve
 *
 * `R > L` is a hard failure — lifecycle would attempt to reap noncurrent
 * versions still protected by Object Lock retention, leaving zombie
 * versions on every reap cycle until R has elapsed. The configuration
 * is incoherent on its face; refuse to serve until R ≤ L.
 *
 * The validator is a pure function over a structured snapshot so each
 * fail-path is unit-tested without mocking the S3 SDK. The capability
 * self-test is mocked via the `BucketSafetyReader` interface so unit
 * tests can pin AccessDenied / 204 / other-error paths without an SDK
 * round-trip.
