/**
 * Boot-time binary `age` identity probe (ADR-0024 § Boot probe).
 *
 * The app refuses to start when the operator-loaded binary `age` private
 * identity is not available — same character as `assertStorageBucketSafe`
 * for ADR-0022. Degraded modes ("uploads-yes-downloads-no", "fall back to
 * plaintext") are explicitly rejected: they would create a misleading-state
 * defect class (ADR-0014) and are unnecessary in a single-operator topology
 * where the boot gate aligns "identity loaded?" with "user can see
 * attachments?".
 *
 * Mirrors `storage/safety.ts`:
 *   - `evaluateBinaryIdentity` is a pure validator over a structured
 *     snapshot of {file present?, readable?, derived recipient?,
 *     configured recipient?}. Each fail-path can be unit-tested without
 *     touching the filesystem or spawning age-keygen.
 *   - `assertBinaryIdentityLoaded` is the orchestrator: it checks the
 *     file, runs `age-keygen -y` (system binary at `/usr/bin/age-keygen`,
 *     verified present in the dev image and the prod app image), builds
 *     the snapshot, calls the validator, and throws an aggregated error
 *     at the boot site.
 *
 * Aggregation contract: every defect detectable from the snapshot
 * surfaces in the verdict's `failures` list — no fail-fast. An operator
 * fielding a failed boot sees every offending arm in one structured
 * message and fixes them in one round, not one redeploy per defect.
 * Mirrors the storage-safety probe's aggregation shape.
