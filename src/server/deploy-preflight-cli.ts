/**
 * Deploy pre-flight entry point. Invoked by `scripts/deploy.sh` INSIDE a
 * one-shot `docker run --rm` against the just-pulled deploy image. The
 * bundled output ships at `dist/server/deploy-preflight-cli.js` (esbuild
 * target list in `package.json` > `build:server`); the host-side
 * `deploy.sh` does not need any project node_modules — it only needs
 * Docker.
 *
 * Five checkpoints, one container start:
 *   1. `validateEnvAggregated()` — schema + every cross-field guard in
 *      one pass. Aborts the deploy on first failure (issue #139,
 *      AC-231).
 *   2. `formatFeatureManifest()` — the same per-feature manifest the
 *      app emits at boot (`event = 'config-feature-manifest'`),
 *      formatted for the operator's terminal so the operator sees what
 *      will be enabled / disabled BEFORE `docker compose up` recreates
 *      containers (AC-230 — the boot-time emission still lands in the
 *      app's stdout for log aggregation; this is the deploy-time
 *      mirror).
 *   3. Storage reachability probe — calls `client.ping()` against the
 *      configured bucket. Catches stale `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY` /
 *      `STORAGE_SECRET_KEY` mismatches, wrong region, missing
 *      capabilities — every operator-side credential class failure
 *      that survives shape validation. Without this step, those
 *      failures only surface at app boot AFTER `docker compose up`
 *      has recreated the app container — at which point the previous
 *      good replica is gone and rolling back means another deploy.
 *   4. Upload-verb probe — signs a presigned PUT to a sentinel key,
 *      executes it with a 1-byte body + matching Content-MD5, asserts
 *      2xx. Catches the class of provider gaps the listing probe in
 *      step 3 cannot see — most concretely, the B2 cutover uncovered
 *      that `POST /<bucket>` returns `501 NotImplemented` (the
 *      previous flow used presigned POST; ADR-0022 § Upload protocol).
 *      Verifying the upload verb at deploy time means a future provider
 *      cutover that drops PUT, breaks SigV4 signed-header binding, or
 *      changes the Content-MD5 contract surfaces here, not at first
 *      user upload.
 *   5. CopyObject-verb probe — server-side-copies the upload sentinel to
 *      a second sentinel key with a tight per-call timeout, asserts
 *      success. This is the canary for the **restore** flow
 *      (`copyFromVersion` in `src/server/storage/client.ts`). The
 *      specific failure mode is B2-specific: an app key without
 *      `writeFileRetentions` on a bucket with default Compliance
 *      retention silently HANGS `CopyObject` for ~5 minutes per attempt
 *      before B2 returns 503; the SDK then retries 3×, totaling ~17
 *      minutes before the user-facing restore call surfaces a 500. See
 *      docs/ops/object-storage-provisioning.md (App key table) for the
 *      cap rationale. Verifying at deploy time means the same
 *      misconfiguration surfaces here, not at first user-clicked
 *      Wiederherstellen.
 *
 * Why a dedicated entry:
 *   - The existing `start.ts` entry point validates AND boots Fastify,
 *     opens DB pool, runs migrations — running it with the `up`-side
 *     effects to JUST check env would double-bind the port and race the
 *     eventual `docker compose up`. A dedicated CLI runs the checks
 *     only and exits.
 *   - Bundling keeps the "shells out to validateEnvAggregated +
 *     formatFeatureManifest" contract stable across schema refactors.
 *     The host-side script doesn't need to track esbuild's
 *     chunk-emission decisions.
 *
 * Aborts the deploy on first failure: prints the aggregated error
 * message to stderr and exits with code 1, which `deploy.sh`'s
 * `set -euo pipefail` propagates to the operator before `docker
 * compose up` runs.
