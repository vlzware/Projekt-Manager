/**
 * Shared periodic-sweeper factory.
 *
 * All three scheduler callers (audit retention, attachment orphan
 * reaper, bulk-download reaper) had identical timer drive and
 * sustained-failure backoff plumbing:
 *   - setInterval + handle.unref() so the timer does not hold the
 *     Node event loop open;
 *   - a `currentSweep` guard so overlapping ticks never race;
 *   - a per-scheduler failure counter that emits `sweep-failed` on
 *     every failure and `sustained-failure` exactly once at the third
 *     consecutive failure, then skips `2^(n - ceiling + 1)` ticks
 *     (capped at 24) until the next attempt;
 *   - a `recovered` line emitted exactly once when a sweep succeeds
 *     after crossing the ceiling;
 *   - `stop()` that cancels the interval and awaits any in-flight
 *     sweep so graceful shutdown doesn't tear down the pg pool or
 *     storage client mid-call.
 *
 * The single-process invariant (ADR-0021) lives on the callers, not
 * here — this factory is deliberately topology-agnostic. A future
 * multi-replica deployment would need a lease/lock at the caller
 * site; nothing in this file would change.
