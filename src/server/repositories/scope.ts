/**
 * Role-based read-scope predicates.
 *
 * Per ADR-0019, scope is orthogonal to permissions. A caller's `project:read`
 * or `customer:read` grants the *capability* to read; these predicates narrow
 * the *extent* — which rows they're allowed to see — as a SQL `WHERE`
 * fragment ANDed into repository queries.
 *
 * The predicate is a pure, total function of the caller's identity,
 * classified by `ROLE_CLASSIFICATION` below:
 *   - unscoped roles → `null` (no additional filter)
 *   - scoped roles   → EXISTS (...) fragment scoped via project_workers
 *
 * Bookkeeper is classified as unscoped as an MVP placeholder (ADR-0019, to
 * be revisited when the invoice-oriented view is introduced).
 *
 * Returning `null` for unscoped callers is load-bearing: callers AND it into
 * a conditions list, and drizzle's `and(cond, undefined)` collapses to `cond`
 * — so a single code path handles both scoped and unscoped queries.
