/**
 * Wipe the current view of the configured object-storage bucket.
 *
 * Mirror of `seed({ force: true })` for object storage: gives every
 * Playwright run a known-empty bucket so test attachments from a prior
 * run cannot leak into a later run's assertions, and the bucket-pollution
 * guard in scripts/sync-dev-to-vps.sh is never triggered by E2E debris.
 *
 * Versioning + Compliance Object Lock ramifications:
 *   The app user's IAM policy denies s3:DeleteObjectVersion (ADR-0022),
 *   so this cannot destroy versions — DeleteObject WITHOUT VersionId on
 *   a versioned bucket only writes a delete marker, demoting the current
 *   version to noncurrent. The actual bytes remain locked under the
 *   bucket's default Compliance retention until R + L days pass and the
 *   lifecycle rule reaps them. That's fine: the goal is a clean current
 *   view at run start, not freed bytes. The accumulated noncurrent
 *   versions on the e2e bucket reap automatically per the same
 *   lifecycle settings as the dev bucket.
 *
 * Safety: refuses to run unless STORAGE_BUCKET differs from the dev
 * bucket name, so a misconfiguration that points the e2e suite at the
 * dev bucket cannot wipe the operator's working data.
