 * Attachment role-gating smoke — the browser-observable slice of the

 * page (AC-206 deep-link, AC-215 bookkeeper-no-delete, AC-217 unscoped
 * read). Server-layer contracts live in `src/server/__tests__/`.
 *
 * Runs under `chromium` (read-only). The spec does not persist any new
 * `attachment` rows — it only asserts visibility and navigation.
 *
 * Pre-seeded projects the test leans on (see
 * `src/server/seed/business.ts` ASSIGNMENT_SPECS):
 *   - suffix `-010` — `arbeiter2` only. `arbeiter1` is NOT assigned, so
 *     the worker-1 storage state gives us a "worker not on project"
 *     case to probe the not-permitted surface.
 *   - suffix `-007` — both `arbeiter1` and `arbeiter2`; usable by any
 *     role that reaches the page to exercise the read-only matrix.

 * context is the cheapest source of truth.
