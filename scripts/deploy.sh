# the deploy, and runs from the target-SHA version of this script.
#
# Why: bash parses `$0` into memory once, at invocation time. The code
# that runs after `git checkout` is still the version bash read BEFORE
# the checkout — which is the *previous* working-tree's deploy.sh, not
# the target SHA's. A roll-forward-then-rollback-then-forward sequence
# silently executes the intermediate SHA's deploy.sh logic on the
# third run (see 2026-04-17 session: first deploy at 773b2b4's
# deploy.sh pulled only `app`; target was e047704 which expected
# `--profile backup pull app backup` — backup image was never pulled
# and the backup service never started; observed as "up 5/5" vs the
# expected 6/6). Re-exec'ing with the newly-checked-out script drives
# the feature matrix from the target SHA, not from whatever happened
# to be on disk at invocation.

# Two changes vs. the previous `source <(age -d …)` form:
#
# 1. Capture-then-eval instead of process substitution. The old form
#    ran age and `source` concurrently (age writing to a FIFO that
#    `source` drained); a 2026-05-03 deploy hit a state where age
#    exited with `incorrect passphrase` without ever showing the
#    prompt, and the script silently fell through to the manifest
#    pre-flight (which then reported every key as missing because
#    nothing got sourced). The exact age/tty interaction at fault
#    isn't pinned down, but command substitution runs age to
#    completion BEFORE bash touches its output, removing the
#    concurrency from the picture entirely.
#
# 2. Capture into a named variable rather than `eval "$(age -d …)"`
#    inline, so that `set -e` aborts the deploy on age failure. With
#    `eval "$(cmd)"`, a failing cmd produces empty input and eval
#    succeeds — the script would still limp into the manifest check
#    instead of stopping at the real error.

# --- Pre-flight: env/secrets parity check --------------------------------

# time the operator synced, but the deployed `.env` / `secrets.env.age`
# was never updated to match. Without this check the deploy proceeds,
# compose interpolates the missing var as an empty string (bare `${X}`
# has no default), and the app either crash-loops on Zod validation or
# — worse — silently runs misconfigured. Abort BEFORE touching the
# running stack: no pull, no restart, no traffic shift until the
# operator has synced.
#
# Two files, two sources of truth, one assertion each:
#   - `.env.production.example` keys ⊆ `/opt/projekt-manager/.env`
#   - `secrets.manifest.txt` keys  ⊆ (env vars exported above)
#
# The secrets check reads from the current process env (populated by
# the `source <(age -d …)` above) rather than re-parsing the encrypted
# file, so we don't prompt for the passphrase twice.

# --- Pre-flight: baseline schema-state recurrence guard --------------
# Drizzle records baseline migrations by sha256 hash in

# produces a new hash, but `migrate()` skips re-applying it because the
# old hash is already in the ledger — the live DB stays on the previous
# schema while schema.ts and the SQL describe the new one. The first
# request that touches a new column 500s with
# `column "<X>" does not exist`.
#
# This guard compares the on-disk sha256 of the baseline file (the
# same digest drizzle-orm uses to populate the ledger — sha256 over
# the raw file content) to the recorded ledger entry, and aborts the
# deploy BEFORE `compose up` recreates app containers and starts
# routing traffic to a stale schema.
#
# Fresh-DB cases fall through cleanly: db service absent (first
# deploy / wiped container), migrations table absent (wiped volume,
# app hasn't booted yet), or ledger empty. The next `compose up`
# runs migrate() which populates the ledger.

# — CI pushes them as a pair per commit SHA (see

# --- Pre-flight: schema-level env validation + feature manifest ------
# Two checkpoints in one ephemeral container:
#
# 1. `validateEnvAggregated()` runs schema + every cross-field guard
#    (AC-231). The two presence checks above (env_example_keys,
#    secrets.manifest.txt) only assert that keys are *declared*; they
#    do not catch shape errors (PORT=0, NODE_ENV=staging, SEED=maybe),
#    nor the dev-default-credential check the schema folds in. A
#    misconfiguration that gets past the presence check would
#    otherwise crash-loop the freshly-recreated container — losing the
#    previous-revision's known-good replicas before the new replicas
#    are healthy. This step catches it without touching the running
#    stack.
#
# 2. `formatFeatureManifest()` prints the same per-feature manifest
#    the app emits at boot (`event = 'config-feature-manifest'`),
#    formatted for the operator's terminal so the operator sees what
#    will be enabled / disabled BEFORE `docker compose up` recreates
#    containers (AC-230). The boot-time JSON emission still lands in
#    the app's stdout for log aggregation; this is the deploy-time
#    operator mirror.
#
# Why `docker compose run --rm --no-deps app` (not `docker run`):
#   - The compose `app.environment:` block hardcodes DATABASE_URL,
#     STORAGE_*, NODE_ENV, PORT (built from operator vars via `${VAR}`
#     interpolation). A standalone `docker run` would see only the
#     operator-supplied env (POSTGRES_PASSWORD, ...) and the schema
#     would reject DATABASE_URL as missing — a false positive that
#     does not match what the actual `up` will give the container.
#     `compose run` resolves the same `environment:` block the live
#     container receives, so the validation environment matches the
#     deploy environment exactly.
#   - `--no-deps` skips starting `db` / `storage` (they may already be
#     up, and we don't need them to validate env). `--rm` removes the
#     one-shot container immediately. `-T` disables TTY allocation so
#     the call works in non-interactive deploy contexts (cron, CI).
#   - The CMD `node /app/dist/server/deploy-preflight-cli.js` runs the
#     dedicated entry built by `package.json` > `build:server` esbuild
#     target list. It prints the aggregated error and exits non-zero
#     on any validation offence; deploy.sh's `set -euo pipefail`
#     propagates the failure and aborts BEFORE `docker compose up`
#     runs. On success, it prints the feature manifest before exiting 0.

# --- Binary-key reload (operator-loaded; ADR-0024 boot probe) --------
# Container recreation wipes the tmpfs at /run/binary-key. The app boot
# probe (assertBinaryIdentityLoaded) waits up to 5 minutes for the
# identity file to appear before declaring boot failure (see
# binaryIdentity.ts DEFAULT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS) — the immediate-throw
# version combined with `restart: unless-stopped` produced a crash-
# restart loop that killed this docker-exec'd loader mid-`read`
# (regression observed 2026-05-03 in the 148-binary-e2e deploy).
#
# We still prompt for the paste here rather than relying on the
# probe's wait window alone: (a) the paste is an operational
# acknowledgment, not just a file-write — the operator confirms they
# are present and the right keypair is loaded — and (b) the smoke
# probe (60s) downstream needs to start AFTER the paste lands so
# its window measures "did the app start?" rather than "did the
# operator paste in time?". Sequence: compose up → operator paste →
# smoke gate → caddy reload.
#
# The drill-key block (further down) runs AFTER the smoke probe because
# its container has no boot gate — backups serve in degraded mode if
# the drill key is missing.

# Skip when the tmpfs is still warm (compose-only changes that didn't

# Caddy graceful reload — re-reads the bind-mounted Caddyfile in place
# so site-block additions (e.g. the `storage.${DOMAIN}` block introduced
# when the storage subdomain wiring landed) take effect on the first
# deploy that ships them.
#
# `docker compose up -d` above only recreates containers whose resolved
# compose stanza differs from the running one; Caddy's stanza is stable
# across most deploys even when its bind-mounted Caddyfile changes. On
# top of that, a file bind-mount pins the container's inode at creation
# time — replacing the on-host file (which is what `git checkout` does
# for any tracked change) leaves the container's file descriptor open on
# the old inode for the current Caddy process lifetime. A `docker restart`
# re-mounts with the new inode but does NOT re-read compose env, so it
# can swap Caddyfile content but keep stale secrets (e.g. CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
# after a rotation). Neither behaviour is obvious enough to remember at
# deploy time.
#
# `caddy reload` sidesteps both by hitting the admin API (bound to
# localhost:2019 inside the container) to re-parse /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
# against the process's current env. Connections stay open across the
# swap. Safe to call every deploy — Caddy exits 0 and logs "config is

# AC-175: load-drill-key still reads the paste over a restricted-mode
# stdin and writes only to tmpfs.
#
# Skip when the tmpfs is still warm (compose-only changes that didn't
