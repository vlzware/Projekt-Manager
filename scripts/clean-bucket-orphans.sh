# Prune local MinIO bucket objects that are not referenced by any row in the
# `attachments` table. Used to clear E2E / abandoned-upload debris before
# scripts/sync-dev-to-vps.sh, without taking down keys that the app still
# considers live (status=ready / pending) or recoverable from the trash
# (status=hidden — the row carries a version_id pointing at a PUT version
# under the hide-induced delete marker, which the un-hide flow needs).
#
# Why this exists: the previous workflow recommended a recursive
# `mc rm --force local/projekt-manager/`, which deletes referenced keys too
# and leaves the gallery + Papierkorb broken until someone manually peels
# the delete markers off the affected version chains.
#
# Safety:
#   - Refuses to run unless the storage container's image is minio/minio,
#     so it cannot point at B2 by accident.
#   - Refuses unless the compose project is `projekt-manager`.
#   - Default mode is a dry-run — no deletions happen without --apply.
#   - Deletes only at the current-version level (creates delete markers).
#     Object Lock + lifecycle reap historical versions in their own time.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/clean-bucket-orphans.sh           # dry-run: print orphans + counts
#   scripts/clean-bucket-orphans.sh --apply   # delete the listed orphans
