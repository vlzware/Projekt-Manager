# VPS side of scripts/sync-dev-to-vps.sh. Not intended to be run directly.
# The orchestrator streams this script over SSH (`ssh hetzner bash -s`) with
# these env vars already transferred plus a $REMOTE_TMP directory on the VPS
# containing db.sql and bucket/ prepared by the orchestrator.
#
# Env contract:
#   REMOTE_TMP       directory on VPS holding db.sql and bucket/
#   MC_IMAGE         minio/mc image tag
#   COMPOSE_PROJECT  compose project name (projekt-manager) — used to find
#                    the running containers. The bucket itself lives at
#                    Backblaze B2 since the ddff944 topology switch (ADR-0022);
#                    this script reads B2 credentials, endpoint, and bucket
#                    name from the running app container's env.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  success
#   1  restore failed (backup container is unpaused if it was paused)
#
# The app container is left running throughout. Earlier versions did
# `docker stop`/`start` to keep psql's DROP/CREATE off open connections,
# but stopping wipes the operator-loaded binary `age` identity from the
# /run/binary-key tmpfs (ADR-0024) and the boot probe then waits up to
# five minutes for an operator paste — the 60 s smoke probe downstream
# always timed out before that paste could land. We clear the app's
# pool with `pg_terminate_backend` instead (same pattern the reverse
# script `sync-vps-to-dev.sh` has used since it landed).
#
# The backup container is `pause`d, not stopped, for the same reason:
# `docker pause` freezes via cgroup freezer so /run/drill-key (AC-175)
# survives, while still preventing dcron from firing a run-backup.sh
# tick mid-restore.

# DeleteObject, which on B2 creates a delete marker — safe under ADR-0022's

# `--md5` is required: the bucket has Compliance Object Lock with a

ERROR: app container restarted during the restore.
  Was:  $APP_STARTED_AT_BEFORE
  Now:  $APP_STARTED_AT_AFTER

The pg_terminate_backend step is meant to be survivable for the app
process — db/connection.ts installs a pool 'error' handler so idle
client errors don't crash the process. A restart here regresses that
contract.

The container's tmpfs at /run/binary-key was wiped by the restart, so
the boot probe is now blocking on the operator paste (ADR-0024).
Recover:

  docker exec -it $APP_CONTAINER load-binary-key
  # paste the age private identity, then Ctrl-D

Then re-run scripts/sync-dev-to-vps.sh.
