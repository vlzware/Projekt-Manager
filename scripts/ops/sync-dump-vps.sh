# VPS side of scripts/sync-vps-to-dev.sh. Not intended to be run directly.
# The orchestrator streams this script over SSH (`ssh hetzner bash -s`) with
# these env vars set. Dumps the VPS DB and bucket into $REMOTE_TMP so the
# orchestrator can rsync them down.
#
# Env contract:
#   REMOTE_TMP       directory on VPS to write dumps into
#   MC_IMAGE         minio/mc image tag (same as app stack uses)
#   COMPOSE_PROJECT  compose project name (projekt-manager) — used to find
#                    the running containers. The bucket itself lives at
#                    Backblaze B2 since the ddff944 topology switch (ADR-0022);
#                    this script reads B2 credentials, endpoint, and bucket
#                    name from the running app container's env.
#
# This script does NOT stop the app — pg_dump holds a consistent snapshot in
# a single transaction by default, and B2 is versioned + content-addressed so
# a concurrent write at most produces a fresh version the next sync will pick
# up. No trap needed because nothing is being stopped or mutated.

# Mirror the bucket into a filesystem directory. `mc alias set` avoids the

# directory an exact mirror of the bucket across repeated runs, matching the
# forward path's semantics. On B2 with versioning + Compliance Object Lock,
# `--remove` issues version-less DeleteObject which creates delete markers
# rather than destroying versions — safe under ADR-0022's capability split
# (the app key has writeFiles but not deleteFiles).
