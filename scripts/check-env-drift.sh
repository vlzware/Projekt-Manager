# Static drift check between src/server/config/env.ts and docker-compose.yml.
#
# Every variable declared in the Zod schema in env.ts MUST be forwarded to
# the app container via `services.app.environment` in docker-compose.yml —
# otherwise the container starts fine, but `process.env.X` is undefined at
# runtime and the app silently falls back to whatever Zod considers the
# default. That class of bug bit us in #57 when BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_* were
# added to the schema but the compose whitelist was not updated; on the
# first deploy the bootstrap hook took the AC-B4 "nothing set → no-op"
# path instead of firing, and the failure was silent.
#
# This check is grep/awk-based rather than a YAML parser so it has no
# dependencies beyond a standard POSIX toolchain (ubuntu-latest GitHub
# runners ship with mawk, not gawk, so portability matters). It is
# intentionally strict: new vars require explicit placement in the
# compose file or explicit entry in the EXCLUDE list below.

# Pass 2: compose `${VAR}` interpolations ↔ (.env.production.example ∪
# secrets.manifest.txt)
#
# The base compose file refers to operator-supplied values via
# `${VAR}` (bare — becomes the empty string when unset, app typically
# fails at runtime) or `${VAR:?…}` (compose aborts file parse). Either
# form means the operator MUST supply the value — so the key has to
# be documented in exactly one of:
#
#   .env.production.example  — non-secret site config (operator edits
#                               in plaintext, copy-paste workflow).
#   secrets.manifest.txt     — secrets sourced from `secrets.env.age`
#                               (age-encrypted).
#
# A key documented in BOTH is a config ambiguity (is the operator
# supposed to put it in .env or in secrets.env.age?) — we fail that
# too.
#
# APP_IMAGE_TAG is the one permitted bare / `:?` reference that is
# NOT operator-supplied: scripts/deploy.sh exports it from the target
# SHA. Exclude it here.
#
# `${VAR:-default}` references are OPTIONAL (compose supplies the
# default); they are not required to appear in either file and are
# skipped here. Documentation of optionals in .env.production.example
# is a style choice the drift check does not enforce.
