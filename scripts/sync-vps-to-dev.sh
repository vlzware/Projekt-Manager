# Destructively overwrite the local dev Postgres database and MinIO bucket
# with whatever is currently on the VPS. Mirror of scripts/sync-dev-to-vps.sh
# for the opposite direction. See docs/ops/sync-vps-to-dev.md for the
# runbook, preconditions, and failure modes.
#
# Why this exists: reproducing a VPS-only bug locally, or resetting dev to
# a known-good deployed state without manually recreating users +
# re-uploading attachments.
#
# Topology note: prod's bucket is on Backblaze B2 since ddff944 (ADR-0022);
# the VPS-side dump helper reads B2 credentials from the running app
# container's env and pulls the bucket via mc. The local restore writes
# into the dev MinIO mirror (docker-compose.minio.yml).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sync-vps-to-dev.sh            # runs preflight only, then refuses
#   scripts/sync-vps-to-dev.sh --i-know   # proceeds after preflight
#
# Preconditions (enforced):
#   - ssh hetzner is reachable as the deploy user
#   - local docker compose stack has `db` and `storage` running (the
#     `storage` service is the dev MinIO mirror)
#   - the baseline migration hash matches between local and VPS
#   - the VPS DB has at least one user (would be pointless to pull an
#     empty/uninitialised DB over the top of local)
#
# What gets overwritten on LOCAL:
#   - Postgres database `projekt_manager` (all tables DROPped and recreated)
#   - Local MinIO bucket `projekt-manager` (objects absent on VPS are deleted)
#
# Stopping `npm run dev` first is optional. The script terminates any
# stray connections to projekt_manager before the DROP TABLE statements
# run; the dev app's pool absorbs the resulting client errors via the
# 'error' handler in src/server/db/connection.ts (attachPoolErrorHandler).
# Restart `npm run dev` afterwards if you want a clean log — the watch
# process keeps running, but transient query errors from the kill
# window will appear in its output before pool reconnect kicks in.

This command will DESTRUCTIVELY OVERWRITE LOCAL:

  - MinIO bucket:      $LOCAL_BUCKET (objects absent on VPS are deleted)

Any local-only state will be lost. Stop 'npm run dev' first to release
