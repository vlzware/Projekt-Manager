# Architecture check — audit-log single-write-path (AC-179, ADR-0021).
#
# Fails CI when a file under src/server/ authors a raw
# INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE against an audited table from outside the
# service-layer `mutate()` helper. The `mutate()` helper is the single
# legitimate writer; every other path must go through it so the audit
# row is produced atomically with the state change (ADR-0021 §Decision).
#
# Audited-table derivation (AC-179 Part 2):
#   The audited-table set is sourced from `AUDIT_ENTITY_TO_TABLE` in
#   `src/server/db/schema.ts`, read via `scripts/print-audited-tables.ts`.
#   That TS mapping carries a `satisfies Record<AuditEntityType, …>`
#   clause, so a new `AuditEntityType` value without a table mapping
#   fails tsc — and a new entity type with a mapping automatically
#   extends this check's scan. Neither direction lets a new audited
#   entity ship with its mutation surface unobserved.
#
# `audit_log` itself is NOT in the audited-table set — `mutate()` is
# its legitimate writer, and the retention-cleanup job is its only
# legitimate deleter. Both are allowlisted below.
#
# Allowlist (ALLOW): files that legitimately author raw mutations
# against audited tables — kept intentionally small and reviewed per
# line at PR time (ADR-0021 §Consequences §Negative).
#
# Exit code:
#   0 — no findings outside the allowlist
#   1 — at least one finding; each is printed file:line, followed by
#       the matched snippet so the reviewer can inspect it.
#   2 — toolchain error (missing ripgrep/grep/tsx, no source tree).

# Scan covers three surfaces:
#   1. Drizzle builder calls:  `.insert(projects)` / `.update(projects)` / `.delete(projects)`
#      — receiver-agnostic (`db.`, `tx.`, `this.db.`, `client.` all match).
#   2. Raw SQL templates:       `` sql`INSERT INTO projects …` ``, `` sql`UPDATE customers …` ``,
#      `` sql`DELETE FROM project_workers …` `` — keyword can appear anywhere inside the
#      template, so compound `` sql`BEGIN; UPDATE projects …` `` still matches.
#   3. Raw `.query()` calls:    `pool.query('INSERT INTO projects …')`, `client.query(…)`,
#      `tx.query(…)` — receiver-agnostic.
#
# Dynamic SQL paths — `sql.raw(...)`, `db.$with(...).delete(...)`,
# runtime-assembled query strings — are NOT detected. ADR-0021 accepts
# this gap for the static check; runtime guards would require the
# trigger belt ruled out in that ADR. When a dynamic-SQL surface is
# added, extend the scanner.
#
# Keyword matching is case-insensitive (`-i`) so `sql`update projects…`` does not
# bypass the keyword family. Table names are lowercase identifiers and stay
# case-sensitive — PostgreSQL folds unquoted identifiers to lowercase, and the
# Drizzle exports + SQL table declarations in schema.ts are all lowercase.

# Files permitted to author raw mutations against audited tables.
# Each entry is a prefix matched against the finding's file path (from
# the scan root, forward slashes). An entry containing `*/…/*` is
# treated as a shell glob and matched anywhere in the path — used for
# nested patterns like `*/__tests__/*`.
#
# Anchoring matters: a prefix like `src/server/repositories/` must
# match the START of the path. The earlier "substring anywhere" form
# would allowlist a malicious `src/server/routes/src/server/repositories/x.ts`
# bypass — see regression test for M4.
#
# See AC-179 for the review contract: adding to this list is a
# reviewed line in the check configuration — not a reflexive escape
# hatch.
