# Bucket-scoped least-privilege policy. Allow list mirrors what the app
# actually does:
#   - GetBucketLocation / GetBucketVersioning / GetBucketObjectLockConfiguration
#     / GetLifecycleConfiguration → boot-time bucket-safety probe reads
#     these to validate the runbook-pinned bucket shape.
#   - ListBucket / ListBucketVersions → prefix listing for the orphan
#     reaper and Papierkorb listing.
#   - GetObject / GetObjectVersion → download path + restore copy source.
#   - PutObject → upload + CopyObject (restore).
#   - DeleteObject (no version-id) → hide path; on a versioned bucket
#     this writes a delete marker and is non-destructive.
#
# Deny block — explicit denials of the destruction capabilities the
# prod B2 app key also lacks. MinIO's "deny overrides allow" semantic
# makes this a hard guardrail: even if a downstream policy mutation
# allowed these, the deny here would still win. Required because
# MinIO's IAM evaluator treats some `s3:Delete*` granular actions as
# subsumed by an `s3:DeleteObject` allow, so omission alone is not
# enough — a `DeleteObjectCommand` carrying a VersionId is granted
# unless `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` is explicitly denied.
#   - s3:DeleteObjectVersion          (would destroy a specific version)
#   - s3:BypassGovernanceRetention    (would bypass GOVERNANCE locks; we
#                                      use COMPLIANCE so this is moot,
#                                      but defensive omission is cheap)
#   - s3:PutObjectRetention / s3:PutObjectLegalHold
#                                     (would let the app shorten retention
#                                      or apply a legal hold — defaults
#                                      come from the bucket, not the app)
# Bucket-mutating actions (PutBucket*, DeleteBucket*, PutLifecycleConfig)
# are absent from the allow list and not explicitly listed here — the
# implicit-deny floor handles them and there is no granular-action
# subsumption issue at the bucket scope.
#
# Resource arrays list every provisioned bucket. With STORAGE_BUCKET_E2E
# set (dev + e2e CI), the app user can read/write both the dev bucket and
# the isolated e2e bucket — the playwright webServer overrides
# STORAGE_BUCKET to the e2e value so test runs target the e2e ARN, leaving
# the dev bucket untouched. Without STORAGE_BUCKET_E2E (the prod-shape
# `check` job), only the dev ARN is granted.
